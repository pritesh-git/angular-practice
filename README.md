This repository contains an Angular application designed for practicing core Angular concepts. It features user authentication (login/signup) and basic blog functionality (create/view blogs).

## Project Overview

This project serves as a learning platform for Angular developers. It demonstrates:

* **Component-based architecture:** Building reusable UI components.
* **Routing:** Implementing navigation between different views.
* **Forms:** Handling user input with Angular forms.
* **Authentication:** Basic login and signup functionality.
* **Data display:** Displaying blog posts.
* **Basic CRUD operations:** Creating and viewing blog posts.
* **Tailwind CSS:** For styling.

## Technologies Used

* **Angular:** Version 18.2.0
* **TypeScript:** Version 5.5.2
* **Tailwind CSS:** For styling.
* **RxJS:** For reactive programming.

- Add more robust authentication (e.g., JWT).
- Implement detailed blog post viewing.
- Add editing and deleting blog posts.
- Add unit and integration tests.
- Improve styling and user experience.
- Add form validation.
- Add error handling.
